## Unit 7: CSS

### SWBATs
+ Explain the purpose and structure of CSS
+ Link an html file to CSS
+ Select specific content to style using tag names, classes, and ids
+ Center text using the text-align property
+ Modify content placement with margin, padding, and border properties
+ Change image size using height and width properties
+ Add background colors using the background property

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ CSS is the key to getting your page looking good. They so don't judge a book by its cover, but a poorly designed website can be a big turnoff for a user who can easily navigate away from it with the click of a button. 

### Lesson Plan
+ Explain difference between Git and Github.
+ Pull up a practice lab and make some changes to it.
+ Explain and model:
  + `git add`
  + `git commit -m "Your message here."`
  + `git status`
  + `git log`
  + `git push origin master`
+ Show students that the GitHub repo has been updated.
+ Explain and model a __pull request__.

### Conclusion / So What?
+ Now that you have the full power of Git and GitHub at your fingertips, collaborating with other developers is fully within your capabilities. This means you can work on some of the hottest coding projects out there, like Rails or Sinatra, and submit pull requests that could result in your code being incorporated into the code base. And when it comes to applying for coding jobs down the road, employers love to see that you've contributed to open source projects.

### Hints and Hurdles
+ `git add/commit/push` - FREEZE everyone and have them do this every 15 minutes to build up the muscle memory.
